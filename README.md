#Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Their Software Requirements

For this project, the goal was to develop a web-based version of the Android game "Draw It or Lose It" for a client, The Gaming Room. The key objective was to keep the team-based competitive gameplay intact while adapting it to a web-based platform. The software needed to support multiple teams, each with several players, ensure that each game and team had a unique name, and maintain only one active game instance at any time.

#What I Did Well in Developing This Documentation

I believe I did a good job in structuring the software design document clearly. I used design patterns like Singleton for managing game instances and Iterator to ensure the uniqueness of names for games and teams. By breaking down the classes and their relationships, I was able to present the design in an organized way that made the requirements easy to follow, which also helped in the actual development phase.

#How the Design Document Helped Me with Development

The design document provided a clear blueprint that made the development process much more manageable. By outlining the class structure and relationships, I was able to understand how each part of the application would fit together. This helped me stay focused and organized throughout the coding process. The document also made it easier to identify potential issues early on, which saved me time and effort later.

#What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of the documentation, I would focus more on detailing the user interface and how users interact with the game. While I covered the main functional aspects of the game, a deeper dive into user flows and UI design would have helped in creating a more seamless user experience. It would also help ensure that the interface matches the gameplay dynamics and makes it easier for players to interact with the system.

#How I Interpreted User Needs and Implemented Them into the Software Design

To interpret the user’s needs, I focused on what was necessary for players to enjoy the game. I considered the ease of joining teams, the ability to track game progress, and ensuring a smooth experience during gameplay. These needs were addressed through the unique name validation and the management of the game state. Considering user needs is crucial because it directly impacts the usability of the game, ensuring it’s fun and functional for players.

#How I Approached Designing Software

I approached the design by first understanding the key functional requirements, then breaking the system into smaller components that could be easily managed. I used object-oriented principles to create a design that was flexible and maintainable. Moving forward, I’d like to use rapid prototyping to quickly test out ideas, as well as gather feedback during the design phase to ensure the final product meets the expectations of the users.
